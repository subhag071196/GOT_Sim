 Go on

 Father’s watching





 And your mother





 Don’t think too much, Bran





 Father will know if you do





 You did well





 What is it



 Now there are five





 You want to hold it

 Lord Stark There are five pups

 One for each of the Stark children

 The direwolf is the sigil of your House

 They were meant to have them





 I’m not a Stark

 Get on





 Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king



 Uncle Benjen!



 Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst





 So take me with you when you go back





 Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will





 I’m ready to swear your oath





 I don’t care about that





 What’re you doing back there



 You’re Tyrion Lannister

 



 Lord Eddard Stark is my father





 What the hell do you know about being a bastard

 I already have one



 Of course I have



 We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years



 Soon enough



 It is good you've got help



  Impressive



  I have something for you

 And it has to be packed very carefully



  Close the door

 This is no toy

 Be careful you don't cut yourself



 So are you

 I had the blacksmith make it for you special

 It won't hack a man is head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough



  You'll have to work at it every day

 How does it feel Do you like the balance

 First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end



  I'm going to miss you





 Careful





 All the best swords have names, you know



  I came to say goodbye to Bran



  I wish I could be here when you wake up

 I'm going north with Uncle Benjen

 

  You Starks are hard to kill



  She was very kind



  It was always my color



  And you, Stark



 Is my mother alive Does she know about me Where I am, where I'm going Does she care

 Why do you read so much

  Is this a trick

 Until your brother killed that King



 Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf



 The Night is Watch protects the realm from







  It is an improvement



 Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me

 No one but you

 My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same



 They hate me because I'm better than they are



 You're leaving

  What kind of reports

 'm ready

 I won't let you down



 But I'm better than every







 Don't stand so still

 It is harder to hit a moving target

 Except for you

 You move too much

 I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me



  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister



  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South

  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him

 Tell him I'd visit if I could



 He'll never walk again



 Farewell, My Lord



 Leg, shoulder, leg

 Left foot forward

 Good

 Now pivot as you deliver the stroke

 Put all your weight behind it



 Enough! He yielded



 Are you sure you want to do this

  I've had worse



 It is not going to get any easier, you know You'll have to defend yourself



  The Wall is no place for cowards



 Come stand by the fire

 It is warmer



 You're not

 You're freezing



  You can't fight

 You can't see

 You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably

 What are you doing here, Sam

  Yes, he is



  Well… You can't get any worse



 Watch duty

 With Sam



 He wasn't hungry



 That is enough

 Sam is no different from the rest of us

 There was no place for him in the world, so he is come here

 We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore

 Never again, no matter what Thorne says

 He is our brother now and we're going to protect him



  No one touches Sam



 I wouldn't doubt it



  Sally on the side

 I didn't think you'd be so upset about it



  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you



  I came very close once

 I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but







  I know where to put it



  Young and gorgeous

 A whore named Ros



 Red



  You don't want to know



 Better



  What is my name

  And why is my surname Snow

 I never met my mother

 My father wouldn't even tell me her name

 I don't know if she is living or dead

 I don't know if she is a noblewoman or a fisherman is wife





 Or a whore

 So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes

 But I couldn't do it

 Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow It is not a good life for a child



 I build my own fires



  Why is he alone

  There is no rider



  That is my Uncle Benjen is horse



  I want to find my Uncle



  I do, my lord



  Yes, my lord



  Will I serve the Lord Commander is meals and fetch hot water for his bath



  Do you take me for a servant

  May I go

  I see Ser Alliser is revenge, that is all



  I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger



  Just these two, My Lord

 Been dead awhile, I'd say



  We should burn them



  Is there any word of my father

  My sisters were in King is Landing too



  Ghost, what is wrong Is something out there

  Commander

  Stay



  Hello

  Commander!

  Move move!

  How do you know that

  What else did the book say

  Soon, he says



  This is Valyrian steel



  My lord, you honor me, but l can't –

  Yes, my lord



  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight



  Yes, my lord



  At what

  What is it

  You can't what

  And yet you really want to say

 You want to say that…

  What What about him

  l should be there

 l should be with him



  Sam said you wanted to see me

  No



  He would do whatever was right, no matter what



  Sam told you



  And this is my day ls that what you're saying

  You do not know

 No one knows

 l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother



  Who are you

  You're Aemon Targaryen



  Get out of my way, Sam



  Better than you do



  l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey is throat

 

  Move



  Move



  Hyah!

  Ghost

  l belong with my brother



  They'll kill you if they know you came after me

 Go back



  l have to



  I don't care about –

  To hell with all of you



  My friends brought me back



  They killed my father



  No





 Having a rough time of it



 What happens to the boys



 He marries his daughters

 What does he do with his sons



 We're not Southerners





 Jon Snow





 Lord commander





 Jon Snow





 Your steward





 What happens to the boys What does he do with his sons



 What’re you doing



 Hello, Gilly

 What’re you doing



 I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -



 What (Stands up)





 No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it is impossible





 Sam we can't take her -



 It is just not possible





 If it is a boy what (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering)

 You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why





 Do what, ask her a question



 Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand



 No you just want to steal her

 What do you think Craster cuts off for that



 We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory

 We can't take a girl with us

 Mormont wouldn't have it

 And even if he would, what would we do with her Who is gonna deliver her baby You



 I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her





 Lord Commander --



 Followed him

 He took the baby into the woods - the newborn





 You don't understand

 He is killing them, all the boys -- you know





 Offerings He is murdering his own children! He is a monster!



 I saw it

 I saw





 something take that child



 He breeds them for the Watch

 The Watch protects him





 We just take the horses and go

  The old man’s no threat





 The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief

  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers





 Ygritte!



 You were right the whole time



 You couldn't have known



 We can't go after them, you know that

 That is what they want



 If they hit Mole is Town, then we're next

 Mance is army must be close



 

 Yes



 No



 Ygritte



 He is dead

 He killed my friend Grenn



 Grenn came from a farm



 Grenn and Mag



 Turn your army around and go home



 I told Tormund and Orell

 We have more than a thousand men



 No, it is like you said, we don't have the men



 I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall



 He was, your grace



 I was this man is prisoner once

 He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life

 I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say



 He is sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe



 No one is going to torture you



 I don't know what happens to the prisoners



 I suppose Stannis does



 I don't have a king



 We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead

 Do you want to say any words over them

 Funeral words

 I don't know how the Free Folk do it



 Say farewell



 She told you

 Get your shield up



 If it wasn’t heavy it wouldn’t stop a sword, now get it up



 Come

 Try it again

 Drive at me

 Keep your shield up

 Or I’ll ring your head like a bell



 Good, good, pivot! Don’t forget to pivot! Shield up!

 You’re not cold, my lady

 No



 Roose Bolton



 I want a great many things, your grace

 But I’m a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch now



 They’re good men



 It’s where she belonged



 They were born on the wrong side of the wall

 That doesn’t make them monsters



 The men of the Night’s Watch are sworn to play no part--

 Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army

 I don’t think that’s likely



 I respect him



 Your grace…

 How much time do I have

 Here we are



 This doesn’t have to be our last meeting



 You know what Stannis wants

 Shouldn’t a king be bold

 You told me you weren’t here to conquer

 You told me your people have bled enough



 You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history

 Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants

 A life’s work uniting them

 You didn’t do it for power

 You didn’t do it for glory

 

 Then bend the knee and save your people



 And how many tens of thousands are out there right now How many women How many children And you won’t go out and rescue them because why You’re afraid of looking afraid



 They’ll burn you alive



 I think you’re making a terrible mistake



 With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do

 You're the man who burned their king alive



 No

 Only one of their own



 The Lord Commander is niece



 "Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark

" (Jon smiles)

 I apologize, Your Grace

 Northerners can be a bit like the free folk

 Loyal to their own



 Most likely



 Unpleasant, I expect



 I don't doubt it, Your Grace

 But I'm a brother of the Night is Watch

 I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword

 I don't know what I have left to give you



 I can't

 Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard

 A Snow



 It is the first thing I ever remember wanting

 I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again



 I'm going to refuse him



 I swore a vow to the Night is Watch

 If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be

 (Stands up)

 Your Grace



 Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont is

 I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience

 One day, he might command



 I have

 And I thank you for it

 You do me great honor

 All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark



 But I have to refuse you

 I'm Lord Commander of the Night is Watch

 My place is here



 I wish I could fight beside you

 Believe me, I do

 But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood

 I pledged my life to the Night is Watch



 I can imagine no higher praise



 May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black

 You saved us from Mance Rayder is army

 We will never forget that

 But it is a question of survival

 The Night is Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely

 Winter is coming



 And the wildlings

 Most of the brothers, yes

 There is little love for the free folk here

 (Olly stares at him)



 I heard it was best to keep your enemies close



 I'm sorry I disappointed him



 As long as he is ruling them



 I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms



 And what needs to be done

 Sam

 (Sam looks up

 Jon looks at Maester Aemon’s chair)

 Maester Aemon

 Take good care of him

 (To the group)

 Brothers

 

 Ser Alliser

 (Silence)

 You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black

 You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack

 I name you First Ranger



 

 Yes, the fort is in a sorry state

 Restore it as best you can

 First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -

 You mistake me, my Lord

 That was a command, not an offer

 Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard



 Are you refusing to obey my order

 Take Lord Janos outside



 Olly, bring me my sword



 If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time



 (To some of the men sparring)

 Good



 Never even heard of these people



 And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us

 Not him



 He murdered my brother



 How can I help you

 Castle Black is my home now

 Night is Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms



 You're gonna show me some vision in the fire

 Forgive me, my Lady

 But I don't trust in visions



 I don't think Stannis would like that very much



 I can't



 I swore a vow

 (Melisandre looks at him incredulously)

 I loved another



 I know

 But I still love her



 Maester Aemon



 Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone



 How are you feeling

 I need your advice

 There is something I want to do, something I have to do

 But it'll divide the Night is Watch

 Bitterly

 Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order



 But you don't know what it is



 Where are the rest of the free folk now (Tormund scoffs)

 Where have they gone (No response)

 Who leads them

 What about you

 What if I unchained you

 Because you are not my enemy

 And I'm not yours



 

 It is



 Because now, (Leans forward), I am Lord Commander of the Night is Watch



 (Stands up)

 I'd have you go north of the Wall

 Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here

 I'll open the gates for them and let them through

 I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall



 I don't want them to kneel for me

 I want them to fight with me when the time comes



 

 Your people need a leader

 And they need to get south of the Wall before it is too late

 We don't have much time and they have less

 The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first

 I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin

 Make peace to save your people



 

 I'll talk to 

 Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing



 And we've slaughtered theirs



 

 Thank you

 (Olly walks away)

 Olly

 (He stops)

 If you have something you want to say to me, say it

 It is all right



 It is not a trick



 I know what it is like to lose the people you love

 I know this is hard for you

 But winter is coming

 We know what is coming with it

 We can't face it alone



 No



 You'll get them back, I swear it

 Have a safe journey, Your Grace

 And thank you



 First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black



 As always, thank you for your honesty



 Thank you, Sam



 Me too



 Does that make me a fool

 He’s not my prisoner



 We’re allies



 We’re not here to fight

 We’re here to talk



 My name’s Jon Snow

 I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch

 We’re not friends

 We’ve never been friends

 We won’t become friends today

 This isn’t about friendship

 This is about survival

 This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there



 In normal times we wouldn’t

 But these aren’t normal times

 The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow

 We’re all the same to them

 Meat to their army

 But together we can beat them



 It’s not a trick

 It’s a gift for those who join us



 Dragonglass

 A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker



 No

 But I trust the man



 Come with me and I'll share these weapons



 There are good lands south of the wall

  

 I knew Mance Rayder

 He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people

 For you

 We’re prepared to give you that new life



 If you swear you join us when the real war begins



 He died



 I’m not asking you to forget your dead

 I’ll never forget mine

 I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall

 But I’m asking you to think about your children now

 They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together

 The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it

 No clan can stop them

 The free folk can’t stop them

 The Night’s Watch can’t stop them

 And all the southern kings can’t stop them

 Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight



 How many are with us 5000

 We’re leaving too many behind



 And he knew them better than I ever will



 Get in line! Get in line!

 Hold the line! Hold the line!

 Get them to the ship and come back for me!

 Now!

 You should be on one of those boats



 You have my word

 I’ve given orders



 Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!

 The Dragonglass!

 The Dragonglass!

 Go! Go! Go!

 Let’s go now! Now!

 He raised his hands

 And they all stood up at once

 Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world



 I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall



 With Longclaw

 I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass

 But Longclaw…

 Not enough

 (pause)

 Here’s to us then

 Long may they sneer



 What

 I need you here, Sam

 If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust

 You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too



 Sam

 Sam…

 You’ve just been beaten half to death

 How did you--

 I’m glad the end of the world’s working out for someone



 We don’t have enough men to make any difference



 The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--

 It’s not their fight!

 Stannis

 He could be lying



 Where is he

 Olly…

 It was a failure

 I went to save them, I failed



 I don’t think that fact’s lost on them
